## What Problem Does This Solve

If you're using OpenClaw, you've probably hit these walls:

| Your Pain Point | Root Cause | How OpenCrew Fixes It |
|----------------|------------|----------------------|
| Your agent gets "dumber" the longer you chat | One agent handles every domain — context bloat | Multiple agents each own their domain, no cross-contamination |
| Juggling multiple projects, constantly switching sessions | No visual task overview | Slack channel = role, thread = task — everything at a glance |
| Every step needs your confirmation — exhausting | Agent doesn't know what it can do on its own | Autonomy Ladder: reversible actions proceed automatically, irreversible ones ask you |
| You hit the same pitfalls again and again | Lessons are scattered across chat history | Three-layer Knowledge Distillation: conversations → structured summaries → reusable knowledge |
| Your agent drifts further off-track over time | Self-adjustments with no audit trail | Dedicated Ops agent handles auditing and drift prevention |

**In one sentence**: The problem isn't that OpenClaw isn't powerful enough — it's that one agent isn't enough. You need a team.

---

## Architecture at a Glance

> Core mental model: **Channel = Role, Thread = Task**

![OpenCrew Architecture](docs/Drawing_2026-02-16_16_58_excalidraw.png)

OpenCrew has three layers, each with clear responsibilities:

**Layer 1: Intent Alignment** — You + CoS (Chief of Staff)

You're the decision-maker. You set direction and sign off on results. CoS is your strategic partner — aligning on your deeper goals and pushing things forward when you're away. CoS is not a gateway; you can jump into any channel and talk to anyone directly.

**Layer 2: Execution** — CTO / Builder / CIO / Research

CTO breaks down work and owns architecture. Builder implements. CIO is the domain expert (defaults to investment, but swap in legal, marketing, or any domain you need). Research investigates on demand.

**Layer 3: System Maintenance** — KO + Ops

KO (Knowledge Officer) distills reusable knowledge from all outputs. Ops (Operations Officer) audits system changes and prevents drift. These two don't do business work — they keep the system healthy.

> Minimum viable setup: CoS + CTO + Builder (3 agents to get running). Add KO / Ops / CIO / Research as needed.

---

## Get Started in 10 Minutes

> Prerequisites: You can already use OpenClaw normally (`openclaw status` works), and Slack is connected.
> If Slack isn't connected yet → [Slack Setup Guide](docs/en/SLACK_SETUP.md) (~20 minutes)

### Step 1: Create Slack Channels + Invite Bot

Create channels in your Slack workspace, then `/invite @your-bot-name` in each one:

| Channel | Agent | Description |
|---------|-------|-------------|
| `#hq` | CoS (Chief of Staff) | Your main conversation window |
| `#cto` | CTO (Technical Co-founder) | Technical direction and task breakdown |
| `#build` | Builder (Executor) | Implementation and delivery |

> Add more as needed: `#invest` (CIO) `#know` (KO) `#ops` (Ops) `#research` (Research)

### Step 2: Let Your OpenClaw Handle the Deployment

Send the following to your existing OpenClaw (replace `<>` with your values):

```
Deploy OpenCrew multi-agent team for me.

Repo: please clone https://github.com/AlexAnys/opencrew.git to /tmp/opencrew
(If already downloaded, repo path: <your local path>)

Slack tokens (write to config, do not echo back):
- Bot Token: <your xoxb- token>
- App Token: <your xapp- token>

I've created these channels and invited the bot:
- #hq → CoS
- #cto → CTO
- #build → Builder

Read DEPLOY.en.md in the repo and follow the deployment process.
Do not touch my models / auth / gateway config — only add the OpenCrew increments.
```

Your OpenClaw will automatically: back up existing config → copy agent files → fetch Channel IDs → merge config → restart.

> Prefer manual deployment? → [DEPLOY.en.md](DEPLOY.en.md) has full manual commands.

### Step 3: Verify

Test in Slack:

1. Send a message in `#hq` → CoS replies ✅
2. Send a message in `#cto` → CTO replies ✅
3. In `#cto`, ask CTO to dispatch a task to Builder → a thread appears in `#build`, Builder replies ✅

## Core Concepts at a Glance

OpenCrew runs on a few key mechanisms. Here's the 30-second overview — full details at → [Core Concepts Deep Dive](docs/en/CONCEPTS.md)

**Autonomy Ladder** — When should an agent act on its own vs. ask you?

| Level | Meaning | Examples |
|-------|---------|----------|
| L0 | Suggest only, no action | — |
| L1 | Reversible actions, just do it | Write drafts, research, organize docs |
| L2 | Has impact but rollback-able, report after | Open PRs, change configs, write analyses |
| L3 | Irreversible, must get your confirmation | Deploy, trade, delete, send externally |

**Task Classification (QAPS)** — Different task types, different handling rules

| Type | Meaning | Needs Closeout? |
|------|---------|----------------|
| Q | One-off question | No |
| A | Small task with a deliverable | Yes |
| P | Project (multi-step, multi-day) | Yes + Checkpoint |
| S | System change | Yes + Ops audit |

**A2A Two-Step Trigger** — How agents collaborate

Since all agents share one Slack bot, the bot's own messages don't trigger itself. So cross-agent collaboration takes two steps: first post a visible message in the target channel (anchor), then use `sessions_send` to actually trigger the other agent. Details at → [A2A Protocol](shared/A2A_PROTOCOL.md)

**Three-Layer Knowledge Distillation** — How chat history becomes organizational assets

```
Layer 0: Raw conversations (for audit, not directly reused)
Layer 1: Closeouts (10–15 line structured summaries, ~25x compression)
Layer 2: KO-distilled abstract knowledge (principles / patterns / lessons learned)
```

## Enable A2A Closed-Loop

> After deployment, each Agent replying independently ≠ Agents collaborating with each other.
> A2A (Agent-to-Agent) closed-loop requires additional configuration and validation.

### What is an A2A Closed-Loop?

You give CTO a dev task in `#cto` → CTO automatically dispatches to Builder in `#build` → Builder executes in rounds within the thread → each round's progress is visible in Slack → CTO reports back to `#cto`. **You only need to watch Slack.**

### Let Your Agent Handle A2A Setup

Send this to your **Ops Agent** (in `#ops`), or any Agent:

```
Help me enable A2A closed-loop.

Reference: read docs/A2A_SETUP_GUIDE.md in the repo

Current state:
- OpenCrew is deployed, each Agent replies normally in their channel
- My Slack channels: #hq(CoS) #cto(CTO) #build(Builder)

Follow the steps in A2A_SETUP_GUIDE.md:
1. Check and complete A2A config in openclaw.json (agentToAgent.allow / maxPingPongTurns)
2. Append A2A collaboration sections to CTO and Builder's AGENTS.md (minimal increment, don't rewrite)
3. Run CTO→Builder closed-loop validation test
4. Report results to me

Do not touch my models / auth / gateway config — only make A2A-related changes.
```

### Manual setup?

## FAQ

**Q: Do I need to know how to code?**

No. OpenCrew was designed and deployed by a non-technical user with an economics/MBA background. You need to be comfortable typing a few terminal commands — or just send the deployment commands to your existing OpenClaw and let it handle everything.

**Q: What's the minimum number of agents?**

3: CoS + CTO + Builder. That's the minimum viable setup. Scale up when you notice experience is being lost (add KO) or the system is drifting (add Ops).

**Q: How is this different from CrewAI / AutoGen?**

Those are SDKs for developers to write code. OpenCrew is a system for decision-makers to manage a team — you manage your AI team through Slack, no code required. They solve "how to orchestrate agents." OpenCrew solves "how to manage an AI team."

**Q: Can I use something other than Slack?**

Slack is the primary interface for now. The architecture is built around "channel = role, thread = task," and Slack's features (thread isolation, Unreads, mobile app) are a natural fit. Other platforms are on the roadmap.

**Q: Won't this burn through a lot of tokens?**

More than a single agent, yes — each agent has its own context. But the Closeout mechanism (~25x compression) and domain isolation (each agent only sees its own domain's information) actually make per-conversation token usage more efficient. Total volume goes up, but each agent runs leaner.

**Q: Does Slack Free plan work?**

Yes. The Slack APIs OpenCrew uses (Socket Mode) are fully available on the free plan. The only limitation is 90-day message history retention, but important information is already distilled through Closeouts and the knowledge base.

## The Journey

This project was built solo by a non-technical OpenClaw user with an economics/MBA background.

It started with discovering that "one agent handling every domain leads to context bloat," evolved into a 7-agent collaboration architecture, and then came a series of technical challenges — A2A loop storms, deliveryContext drift, and more. The full record of pitfalls and design decisions is at → [The Journey](docs/en/JOURNEY.md)

**Why open-source now?** The system has been running in real use and iterating steadily, but some edge cases remain unsolved. Rather than wait for "perfect," we're putting the working framework out there — so more people can give feedback, co-build, and evolve it together.
